**Product Management**

- Working at [Yara International](https://www.yara.com/digital-farming/) to solve problems for farmers and food producers against changing climate enviroment and increasing demand with different sets of digital products.

**Learning**

- Working for your own side project means tons of learning from how to figure out payments, legal stuff, technicial implementations, design decisions! 
- Yet, the fun part is working with LLMs and seeing how it changes the product development. I'm trying to improve my prompt engineering skill these days.

**Podcasts**

- The Ben and Emil Show
- Lenny's Podcast by Lenny Rachitsky
