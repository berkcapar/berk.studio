# What to expect

Hello,

Iâ€™ve been around on earth for 28 years, spending almost a quarter of it on digital products and their developments. I thought it would be nice to have a blog, formatted as a journal, drawing from my past experiences. 

Currently, new posts are in the writing process and sooner, they will be placed here, in their new homes. Until then, here is a surrealistic painting from Korean artist Jung-Yeon Min.
